# fix the proublem

we need to config the `keyboard shortcuts`

config -> `keyboard shortcuts` --> append the following code block to `keyboard shortcuts.json`

```c
{
       "key": "tab",
       "command": "selectnextsuggestion",
       "when": "editorTextFocus && suggestWidgetMultipleSuggestions && suggestWidgetVisible"
},
{
       "key": "shift+tab",
       "command": "selectPrevSuggestion",
       "when": "editorTextFocus && suggestWidgetMultipleSuggestions && suggestWidgetVisible"
}
```
